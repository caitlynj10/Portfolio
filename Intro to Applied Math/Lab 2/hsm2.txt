Sharpay! Forget about the rest of us,
how about the fact that your brother has worked
extremely hard on this show? Oh, boo-hoo. He'll be in the show.
He'll do his celebrity impersonations. And don't lecture me about Ryan,
given the way you've been interfering with Troy's future.
What? You've gotten him written up by Fulton
for sneaking on the golf course, swimming after hours.
I had to step in just to save Troy's job.
I'm not interested in what you think
you're doing for Troy. That's between you and him.
But you're messing with my friends, my summer,
and that's not okay with me. You don't like the fact that I won.
What's the prize? Troy? The Star Dazzle Award?
You have to go through all of this just to get either one?
No, thanks, Sharpay. You're very good at a game
that I don't want to play, so I'm done here.
But you better step away from the mirror
long enough to check the damage
that will always be right behind you. Girls!
